I used Lovable.dev to generate the initial template for the website.  
The AI-generated code included:

- Basic HTML structure  
- Simple header and navigation layout  
- A starter hero section  
- Basic section divs for About, Skills, and Footer  
- Default CSS for layout
1.Navigation / Header

“Replaced the AI-generated navigation with a fully responsive hamburger menu for mobile and tablet. Added site logo/title and ensured proper layout across devices.”

2️. Hero Section
“Rewrote the hero section with personalized introduction, professional heading, description, and a call-to-action button.”

3️.About Section
“Updated About section with personal introduction, professional experience, and interests for authenticity and better readability.”
